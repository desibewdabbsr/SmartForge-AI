Sure! Here's how you can create your first Flask application that says "Hello World":

```python
from flask import Flask  # Import the Flask module, which is an instance of WSGI web server software    for Python   .
app = Flask(__name__)     # Create a new 'instance' of the Flask class. The argument '__name__' refers to the name or unique ID that this file has in its program  (i.e., it is current module) if imported as main, else __file__ .
  
# Route function for '/'. This will be executed when you access your webpage URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/. Here we are telling the Flask server to use a specific Python file (views) and method in it ('run') as our main page/application functionality .
@app.route('/')  # The function that will run when you access this route, ie., 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'   is equivalent to calling hello_world() from the views module in your Flask application.    It’s like a URL router for our web app .
def hello_world():     # The function that will run when you access this route, ie., 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' is equivalent to calling sayHello() from the views module in your Flask application which displays a simple page saying "Hello World!" .
    return 'Hello world!'  # This returns what you want as output, ie., whatever string (in this case hello_world) we passed into it. In our example: http://127.0.0.1:5000/   will display the message " Hello World!" .
     if __name__ == '__main__':  # You can run multiple copies of your program by specifying -h or --help option, which returns False in this case and an error is not issued because Flask does it for us. This ensures that you only start one instance of the application when running "python filename.py" on a Unix/Linux system using python3 (or another Python interpreter).
        app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # run() method starts our server, and you can check it at http://127.0.0.1:5000/. By default the host is 'localhost'(only visible to localhost). The main advantage of using this approach (as opposed with threading or multiprocessing which require explicit management) over process-based solutions like flask's wsgi server, and Gunicorn/uWSGI are that you can actually start multiple workers for handling concurrent requests.
```  # In python we have to use 'app', not just app as it is defined in the Flask module .   So when using a class-based approach (like our code does), this name isn't relevant and won’t be used unless you specifically ask that question! But for simplicity I changed your variable names.
```python  # You can use HTML tags by wrapping them within {{ }} in Jinja2 template engine or directly using html functions from Flask module like render_template, Markup etc which also uses templates (HTML files) and a server-side language called Python to generate the final response for each request.
```python  # For more information about this see http://jinja.pocoo.org/2013/templates/. And https: //flask.palletsprojects.com /en/1.1.x /blueprints/quickstart#render-template .
```python  # In Python, if you are looking for the equivalent of a C++ 'main' function then use def main() and pass an argument to run(host="0.0.0.0", port = 5001). This is also where your server starts listening on HTTP requests from clients: http://www.cplusplus.com/forum/beginner/articles/what-are-the-definitions-of-main-839/.
