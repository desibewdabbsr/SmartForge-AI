Sure! Here's an example of how you could implement the basic structure in Solidity (a programming language used by smart contracts on Ethereum blockchain). This is just a very simplified version and doesn't include any real-world logic or security considerations, but it should give you some good starting points.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.5.16; // Use the correct Solidity version for your project (replace with actual versions) 2>/dev/null && abigen --version || echo "Run 'abigen' first to install" >&2 ; false OR true, so we can use if
contract SimpleContract {
    uint public data; // Declare a state variable called `data` of type unsigned integer. This is initialized as 0 in the constructor and cannot be changed afterwards. It could also set its initial value later on using function sets() below: 'constructor () public returns (uint)', line -1}
   mapping(address => uint256) balances; // Declare a state variable called `balances` of type map where the keys are addresses and values represent balance. 0 in constructor is initialized as well, it could also set its initial value later on using function sets() below: 'mapping (address=>uint256)'
   event Log(string message); // Declare an event called `Log` which can be triggered when a certain action happens and contains some string information. This only triggers once in the contract, it does not change after being sent out by anyone else using send or transfer function calls: 'event', line -1}
   error NotEnoughBalance(address sender); // Declare an custom type of errors called `NotEnoughbalance` which could be thrown when there is insufficient balance for a certain action. This can only trigger once in the contract, it does not change after being sent out by anyone else using send or transfer function calls: 'error', line -1}
   modifier public { // Declare that this view will return 32 bytes data of type string (a label), which is a name to identify when we call methods on our contract. This should be used in place for all non-payable and payable functions within the constructor: 'modifier', line -1}
   modifier only(address _owner) { // Declare that this view will return 32 bytes data of type string (a label), which is a name to identify when we call methods on our contract. This should be used in place for all non
