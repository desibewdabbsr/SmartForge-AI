Sure, here's an example of how your Solidity smart contract might look like in Ethereum version v2 (Solidity):

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4; // use the correct compiler version for this deployment target, currently 0.5 and later versions are supported by Solium analyzer only up to pragma solc >= 0.6 compatibility mode on Remix IDE (default) as well in current remix ide configuration
// This is a simple storage contract that can hold an integer value between limits defined below: it starts with the first limit set at 1 and grows until reaching maximum allowed size of uint256 which results to being approximately around ~38.4 million times bigger than actual real-world usage due as one byte (0xFF) is represented by two bytes in solidity
contract SimpleStorage {
    // Define the data types that we're going to use for our storage: uint means unsigned integer, which can store values from 0 till max value of an unsigned int. Here between limit set at around ~38 million times bigger than actual real-world usage due as one byte (256) is represented by two bytes in solidity
    using SafeMath for uint; // This library provides a `SafeMath` version that can perform safe math operations, which are required to prevent overflows or underflows. It'll be used here instead of hardcoding values as we do not want them set at the limit (0xFF * 256)
    uint private _value; // Variable for storing our data - it starts with value = 1 and grows until reaching max allowed size, which is approximately around ~38.4 million times bigger than real-world usage due as one byte in storage can represent up to two bytes (0xFF). We do not want this set at the limit here
    constructor() public { // Constructor that runs when a new instance of contract gets deployed - it sets our value variable with initial values 1 and max allowed size, which is approximately around ~38.4 million times bigger than real-world usage due as one byte in storage can represent up to two bytes (0xFF).
        _value = 256; // Set the first limit at a very big number - it starts with this value already set and grows until reaching max allowed size, which is approximately around ~38.4 million times bigger than real-world usage due as one byte in storage can represent up to two bytes (0xFF)
    }
     // Define our public functions: a way for others(contracts/users who call these function on this contract), or internal services, etc., that we could interact with - they would be called via msg.value and other built-in variables in smart contracts like eth_call() by default (it'll send Ether to the address from which you are calling)
    // For example: public pure returns(bool){return _someData[arg1] == arg2;} - a function that will return bool value based on whether some data is equal or not. It can be used as an external service in our contract, like check if user has enough balance to withdraw money from the account
    // Note: This example assumes you have already defined `_someData` array with your own logic for accessing storage - otherwise it will fail at runtime and throw error about uninitialized variable. (You need a way of defining what data should be stored in smart contract) – You can do this by yourself or use precompiled contracts, if you are not familiar then go through the tutorial on solidity development environment
    function set(uint x) public { // A method that allows to store some value into our storage. It's called when someone wants change data (it should be a way for others/contract users who call this functions). Argument is `x`, which could represent new limit size of the contract as per real-world usage
        _value = x; // Set variable with current value set by user or default initialised at 256 in constructor. If any other operation fails due to overflows (overflow), then this will fail and revert back all changes made up until that point, effectively 'rollback' the transaction so we don’t have partial state
    }
}   // Close of contract definition brace {...}. It represents our storage unit. ‘SimpleStorage is a name for it now'. Remember to use this syntax when defining and calling functions in your smart contracts as per solidity language rules (it'll be written with lower-case) - you can find the full guide on writing, deploying or interacting via Ethereum blockchain at: https://solidity.readthedocs.io/v0.8/tutorial/ Writing and Deploying Contracts in Solidity
```   // Close of contract code bracket } – It'll be used as an example to show how you can interact with your smart contracts via Remix IDE, Ganache or any other Ethereum blockchain development environment. You should replace the function calls and variable names according to actual requirements in real world scenario
